# CP476-Final-Project

Goals accomplished:
- Setup both main and update pages. 
- Created Movie Database and table
- Finished code for connectToTheDB.php, remove.php and base.php
- Able to successfully sent data from web form to the database
- 

Things that still need work:
- Need to finish the update.php code so entries will update properly
- The second page is not displaying correctly
- Release_Date is not being updated properly in the table

Optional Ideas:
- Add more options for Movie Genres
- Improve look of second page. (Prof probably doesn't care though)
